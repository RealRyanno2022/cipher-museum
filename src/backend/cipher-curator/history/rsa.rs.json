{"history": "RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission. It was developed in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman at MIT. RSA's security is based on the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers. The algorithm supports key lengths that can provide various levels of security, commonly 2048 bits or more. RSA is foundational to many encryption and authentication protocols, including SSL/TLS for internet security. Despite newer algorithms, RSA remains a cornerstone of modern cryptography."}
