{"history": "SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) is a member of the SHA-2 family, designed by the National Security Agency (NSA) and published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001. It generates a fixed-size 256-bit hash value from an arbitrary amount of input data. SHA-256 is widely used in security applications and protocols, including SSL/TLS, PGP, SSH, and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Its design improves upon the earlier SHA-1 algorithm, offering greater security against collision and preimage attacks. SHA-256's robustness and widespread adoption make it a critical component of modern digital security."}
