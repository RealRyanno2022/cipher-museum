{"history": "The Great Cipher, invented by Antoine and Bonaventure Rossignol in the 17th century, was used by Louis XIV of France for secure communication. This cipher remained unbroken for over 200 years, highlighting its complexity and the skill of its creators. The Great Cipher utilized a system of numbers to represent syllables rather than individual letters, making frequency analysis exceedingly difficult. It wasn't until the late 19th century that the cipher was finally deciphered by French cryptanalyst \u00c9tienne Bazeries. The Great Cipher's innovative approach significantly influenced the development of cryptographic techniques in subsequent centuries."}
