{"history": "The Vigen\u00e8re cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. It was first described by Giovan Battista Bellaso in 1553 but is often misattributed to Blaise de Vigen\u00e8re, who later developed a stronger autokey cipher. The Vigen\u00e8re cipher uses a keyword to determine the shift of each letter in the plaintext. Although it was once considered unbreakable, the cipher was eventually broken in the 19th century by Charles Babbage and Friedrich Kasiski. Despite this, the Vigen\u00e8re cipher remains a popular teaching tool for illustrating basic cryptographic concepts."}
