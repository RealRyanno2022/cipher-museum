{"history": "Blowfish is a symmetric-key block cipher designed by Bruce Schneier in 1993. It was created as a fast, free alternative to existing encryption algorithms. Blowfish features a variable key length from 32 bits to 448 bits, making it adaptable for different security levels. The algorithm operates on 64-bit blocks and consists of 16 rounds of encryption. Blowfish quickly gained popularity due to its performance and flexibility, especially for embedded systems. While newer algorithms like AES have surpassed Blowfish in widespread usage, it remains a significant milestone in the evolution of cryptographic techniques and is still used in certain legacy systems and software."}
