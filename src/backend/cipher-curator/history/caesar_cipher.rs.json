{"history": "The Caesar cipher, named after Julius Caesar, is one of the oldest known encryption techniques. Used by Caesar for private communication, it is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on. Despite its simplicity and ease of breaking with modern cryptographic techniques, the Caesar cipher laid the groundwork for the development of more complex encryption methods. It remains a popular introductory example in the study of cryptography."}
