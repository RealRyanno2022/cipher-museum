{"history": "The Enigma machine was an encryption device used primarily by Nazi Germany during World War II. Invented by the German engineer Arthur Scherbius at the end of World War I, the machine uses a series of rotating wheels or rotors to scramble plaintext messages into ciphertext. Each rotor changes the electrical pathway in a complex manner, creating an almost unbreakable code. However, the Allies, notably the Polish mathematician Marian Rejewski and later the British codebreakers at Bletchley Park including Alan Turing, were able to break the Enigma code. This breakthrough is considered one of the pivotal moments of the war, significantly contributing to the Allied victory."}
