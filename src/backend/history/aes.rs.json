{"history": "Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) was established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001. It replaced the older Data Encryption Standard (DES) due to its enhanced security. AES was developed by Belgian cryptographers Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen, and is also known as the Rijndael cipher. The algorithm was selected through an open competition that started in 1997, with the final decision being made in 2000. AES operates on a 128-bit block size and supports key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits. It has become one of the most widely used encryption methods globally, ensuring secure data transmission and storage across various platforms and applications."}
