{"history": "Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) was independently proposed by Neal Koblitz and Victor S. Miller in 1985. ECC is based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. It provides equivalent security to traditional systems like RSA but with smaller key sizes, resulting in faster computations and reduced storage requirements. ECC has been increasingly adopted for securing internet communications, including SSL/TLS for web security, and is used in various standards and protocols such as PGP, SSH, and Bitcoin. Its efficiency and strength make ECC a preferred choice for modern cryptographic applications."}
